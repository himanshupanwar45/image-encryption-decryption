# image-encryption-decryption
This app encrypts the image with a highly secure Rubikâ€™s cube encryption technique and is capable of fast encryption that can be used for real-time internet transmissions. 
Language Used : Python

You can read more about Rubik's Cube algorithm here : https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jece/2012/173931/

Folders & Files specifications : 
1. decrypted : In this folder we will get the images after decryption.
2. encrypted : In this folder we will get the images after encryption.
3. input     : In this folder, I have provided with some sample image inputs.
4. keys      : Here we will store our keys which we will generate during encryption.
5. decryptModule : it contain algorithm for decrypting image.
6. encryptModule : It contain algorithm for encrypting image.
7. gui           : it contain the code for user interface part.
8. helperModule  : It contain functions which will help us in encryption & decryption.


TO EXECUTE THIS PROJECT, WE JUST HAVE TO RUN THE GUI.PY FILE.
